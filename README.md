> **IMPORTANT**: Any student submitting the codes as their own is an act of plaigarism and 
is a violation of Washington State University's *"Student Honor's Code"*. The 
intention of us posting this program is for collaboration and to hear 
feedbacks on possible improvements on the coding. This code repository also serves as part of our code 
portfolio and its purpose is for future employers to examine our coding skills. Please reference 
if you use part of the code and **DO NOT PLAGIARIZE**. *"Academic Dishonesty"* falls under 
the *Standards of Conduct for Students*.
